Introduction

generateUUIDGEN is a simple automated bash script that generates a user specified amount of SmUUIDs

Simply download and unzip the generateUUIDGEN.zip folder to your Desktop. Open the unzipped folder and double click the generateUUIDGEN.command file and then follow the on screen instructions.

You'll be greeted with:
```
How many SmUUIDs would you like to create? 
```
Type an integer greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to 100 (for example: 10)

You will see an output like:
```
1: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
2: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
3: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
4: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
5: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
6: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
7: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
8: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
9: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
10: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Now you copy and use one of the SmUUIDs generated!

*Note: If you type an invalid character, then that will temporarily stop the script! Wait a few seconds and it will restart on its own!
