# generateUUIDGEN
Introduction

generateUUIDGEN is a simple automated bash script that generates a user specified amount of uuidgen's

Simply unzip the folder generateUUIDGEN_v1.0.0.zip to your Desktop, open a Terminal window, and drag and drop the file "generateUUIDGEN_v1.0.0" into the Terminal window and hit the Return key.

You'll be greeted with:
```
"How many uuidgenâ€™s do you want to create?
```
Type an integer greater than 1 (for example: 10)

You will see an output like:
```
1:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
2:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
3:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
4:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
5:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
6:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
7:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
8:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
9:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
10:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Now you copy and use one of the uuidgen's generated!

*Note: If you type an invalid character(s) or 0, then that will abort the script! You'll have to reload it to continue!
