# generateUUIDGEN
Introduction

generateUUIDGEN is a simple automated bash script that generates a user specified amount of SmUUIDs

Simply download and unzip the generateUUIDGEN.zip folder to your Desktop. Open the unzipped folder and double click the generateUUIDGEN.command file and then follow the on screen instructions.

You'll be greeted with:
```
How many SmUUIDs would you like to create? 
```
Type an integer greater than 1 (for example: 10)

You will see an output like:
```
1: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
2: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
3: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
4: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
5: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
6: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
7: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
8: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
9: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
10: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Now you copy and use one of the uuidgen's generated!

*Note: If you type an invalid character or 0, then that will abort the script! Wait a few seconds and it will restart the script for you!
